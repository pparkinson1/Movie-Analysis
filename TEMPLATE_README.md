### Business problem:
Microsoft* sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. 

Our team analyzied movie data from  [Box Office Mojo](www.boxofficemojo.com), [IMDB](www.IMDB.com), [Rotten Tomatoes](www.rottentomatoes.com), and [TheMovieDB.org](www.TheMovieDB.org) to help them better understand the movie industry. 

### Recommendations:

After lookin at x, y, and z we focused on number of clowns per movie, combined with Director of the movie, as the most useful metrics to measure movie potential. We created a new variable to capture to the clowns to actors ratio and as you can see in these two visuals that have nothing to do with our analysis, they clearly show that point:

#### Visual 1

#### Visual 2
